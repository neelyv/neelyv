Hi, I’m @neelyv, and I’m interested in technical writing and web development. Here's what I'm working on lately:

- Going through the Foundations courses in The Odin Project
- Learning about building static websites with Jekyll
- Recording audiobook sections for [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/reader/16022)
