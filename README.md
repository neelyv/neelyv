Hi, I’m @neelyv, and I’m interested in technical writing and web development. 

What I'm working on lately:

- Brushing up on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by going through the Foundations course in The Odin Project
- Learning about building static websites with Jekyll
- Recording sections of audiobooks for [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/reader/16022)
